    <h1>Downloading Large DB of GM Games for HIARCS Chess Explorer Pro</h1>
    
    <p>Yes, HIARCS Chess Explorer Pro supports importing chess game databases in PGN format (among others like HCE and ChessBase formats), so you can easily add large collections of GM games from external sources.<sup>[10]</sup></p>
    
    <p>There are several free options available online for downloading substantial PGN databases that include GM games. Here's a breakdown of some reliable sources:</p>
    
    <h2>Targeted GM-Focused Collections (Smaller but Specific)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>PGN Mentor</strong>: Offers free downloadable PGN files organized by individual GMs (e.g., thousands of games each for players like Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura, or Fabiano Caruana), major events (e.g., World Championships from 1886 onward, Candidates tournaments), and openings (e.g., tens of thousands of games per variation like Queen's Gambit Declined or French Winawer). These are ideal for studying specific GMs or lines without overwhelming size.<sup>[0][3][13]</sup> Download from: <a href="https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html">https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html</a></li>
        
        <li><strong>Games of GMs PGN</strong>: A free 442,000-game PGN collection specifically of GM games (note: may contain some duplicates).<sup>[15]</sup> Download from: <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/gqx8b0xaixl4hwe/Games+Of+GMs.7z/file">https://www.mediafire.com/file/gqx8b0xaixl4hwe/Games+Of+GMs.7z/file</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Massive Multi-Million Game Databases (Including GM Games)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LumbrasGigabase</strong>: A free database with over 16.6 million games total (9.5 million over-the-board and 7.1 million online), available in PGN format (as well as SCID). It includes many GM and high-level games but also filters in others rated above 1800 ELO, making it suitable for broad study.<sup>[1][4][14]</sup> Download from: <a href="https://lumbrasgigabase.com/en/">https://lumbrasgigabase.com/en/</a></li>
        
        <li><strong>Lichess Open Database</strong>: Provides free monthly PGN dumps with billions of games (over 7 billion total as of recent counts), including classical time controls where you can filter for high-rated (GM-level) games after downloading. It's not exclusively GM-focused but vast and useful for analysis.<sup>[2][8]</sup> Download from: <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">https://database.lichess.org/</a></li>
        
        <li><strong>9 Million+ Games PGN (from TWIC Archives)</strong>: A free 9 million-game PGN file (about 8.6 GB), compiled from The Week in Chess (TWIC) archives, which focus on high-level tournaments and include many GM games.<sup>[7][15]</sup> Download from: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8QWIkjhrOJdqkNrlN19nnWQpeww-2mv/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F8QWIkjhrOJdqkNrlN19nnWQpeww-2mv/view?usp=sharing</a><br>
        For ongoing updates, check TWIC directly at <a href="https://theweekinchess.com/twic">https://theweekinchess.com/twic</a> for weekly PGN files of recent pro tournaments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="note">Note that some larger databases like Opening Master (31 million games) or 365Chess (over 4 million) require paid subscriptions for full downloads, so I've focused on free options here.<sup>[5][6][11][12]</sup> Once downloaded, you can import the PGN files into HIARCS via its database management tools. If you're dealing with very large files, ensure your system has sufficient memory, as HIARCS can handle them but performance varies.</p>
